# Hooke Website

Browser UI for [HookeJs](https://github.com/oekshido/HookeJs). It requires CORS to be unblocked, which can be done using extensions like [CORS Unblock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino/). It makes use of localstorage, for storing the page, so it has a limit on length of about 5mb (Slightly longer than the bible).
